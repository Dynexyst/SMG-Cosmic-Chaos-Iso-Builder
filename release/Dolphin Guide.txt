You need to do this in order to play Super Mario Galaxy Cosmic Chaos on Dolphin.

1. Open the settings window in Dolphin (Options -> Configuration)
2. Press 'Enable cheats'
3. Right click your game in Dolphin and press 'Properties'
4. Go to 'Game Config' and then 'Editor'
5. Paste in the contents of 'COPYME_dolphin.txt' into the 'User Config' field
6. Close the properties window and open it again (to reload it)
7. Navigate to 'Gecko Codes' tab and if you did everything correctly,
   the code to get the game to work should be there and enabled. There should
   also be a code for each region, please enable the one your game is from.

Have fun :)
