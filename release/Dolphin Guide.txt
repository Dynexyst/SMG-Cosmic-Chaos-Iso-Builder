You need to do this in order to play Super Mario Galaxy Cosmic Chaos on Dolphin.

1. Open the settings window in Dolphin (Options -> Configuration)
2. Press 'Enable cheats'
3. Right click your game in Dolphin and press 'Properties'
4. Go to 'Game Config' and then 'Editor'
5. Paste in the contents of 'COPYME_yyy.txt' (yyy ) into the 'User Config' field
6. Close the properties window and open it again (to reload it)
7. If you did everything correctly, reopening the properties window and
   navigating to the 'Patches' tab should show a code called SMGCC.

Have fun :)
