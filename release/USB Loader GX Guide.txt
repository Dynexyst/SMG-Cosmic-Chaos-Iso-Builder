You need to do this in order to play Super Mario Galaxy Cosmic Chaos on USB Loader GX.

NOTE: I highly recommend changing the Game ID as well as the TMD ID in the builder,
this way the Wii will create a separate save file for Kaizo (You will have to change any one of the files
in '/txtcodes/' to match this new Game ID, though)

1. Move the 'txtcodes' folder to your Wii's SD Card
2. Enable 'Ocarina' in 'Game Load' settings for Super Mario Galaxy Cosmic Chaos
3. Below the 'Game Load button there should be a button called 'Ocarina', press it
4. Turn on 'Main'. Finally, press create
